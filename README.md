Combat Remake/Remaster is a project by Sean Ross. This was made during my time at General Assembly in Seattle. Combat Remake/Remaster is a two player game controlled by WASD/Space for player one and Arrow Keys/Enter/Return for player two. Try to score as many points as you can by killing your opponent before the timer runs out. Make to play like the Atari Combat game.

## Day 1 / Day 2 (First Weekend)
To start the week I really sat down and tackled learning Phaser. The framework itself made life alot easier making the game however, learning a new framework was going to be a challenge. I tackled this challenge head on and watched many tutorials and went through as much documentation as I could when trying to tackle this challenge. Little did I know there are alot more hurdles to jump in regard to game making than just learning the framework.
