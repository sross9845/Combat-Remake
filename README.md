# Combat Remake/Remaster
Game Link: https://sross9845.github.io/Combat-Remake/<br><br>
Combat Remake/Remaster is a project by Sean Ross. This was made during my time at General Assembly in Seattle. Combat Remake/Remaster is a two player game controlled by WASD/Space for player one and Arrow Keys/Enter/Return for player two. Try to score as many points as you can by killing your opponent before the timer runs out. Made to play like the Atari Combat game.
## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and my new love hate relationship Phaser.

## Day 1 / Day 2 (First Weekend)
To start the week I really sat down and tackled learning Phaser. The framework itself made life alot easier making the game however, learning a new framework was going to be a challenge. I tackled this challenge head on and watched many tutorials and went through as much documentation as I could when trying to tackle this challenge. Little did I know there are alot more hurdles to jump in regard to game making than just learning the framework.

## Day 3
Day three had its own hurdles to start the work off. I tried my hand at getting a sprite onto my page, easy enough right? Well all the tutorials I used use the phaser examples assets. I wanted to use my own to create a closer resembelance to the base game I was trying to recreate. This however was NOT working and I figured out why at a later date. Feeling defeated with that to start learning my first framework I used Phasers example tank. This worked perfectly as an example. I got one tank fully up and running which was awesome to see. I figured out the world bounds collision detection and the bullets. Messed around slightly with the speed of both the tank and the bullets. Getting the bullets to come out at the same angle as the tank was fun. I attached it to my turret sprites on the tanks.

## Day 4 
Day Two started with yet another challenge. I tried to add in a Tile Set and Tile Map into my code. Yet again something I have seen done but only with example phasers. I went through line by line of the documentation and could not get it to work yet again. My plan was to get the interaction of the tile map with the tank and bullets that are currently here to make it easier to make my Player 2. However I decided to forge ahead and make the kill function and second player that day. 

## Day 5
I started the day just trying to do a few small manageable things like the score counter and the timer. These took alittle longer than anticipated to figure out. Nonetheless I was on to the bitmap again. I was dedicated to getting this to work but it never really came out like it was supposed to. I fixed a few random properties of the tanks again and then attempted the bouncy bullets. These turned out really well for the first bounce and then faultered after that. I tried to get this figured out for the rest of the day until moving that to my stretch goals.

## Day 6
I figured out ALOT of my problems today, maybe alittle too many as it created alot of work for me to do on my final day. I GOT THE TILE MAP TO WORK. I followed a few more instructions and did it the same as before but it needed to be hosted on a Server to work. The browser was acting funny with my code. The sprites however were still not working. I came up with an idea I should have awhile ago and uploaded the images to imgur. Using the URL worked perfectly. However since this does not have a turret sprite I had to delete and change up alot of my code. I attempted to add a reset function that creates a fun and groovy strobe like animation to everything that unfortunately was not intenended but tempted to add it somehow as a feature in later versions. This is the major problem that still persists me. I learned about this beautiful thing called phaser states on the last day... this would have solved my problem of having a starting screen and a reset function that actually works.

## Day 7
Working on this ReadMe and styling the page up. Not alot of time before we present. 

## Errors left and future plans
-The reset function still does not work. <br>
-A player still can spawn on un shootable blocks and be invincible, however rarely happens . <br>
-Learning more about phaser states to create a menu screen and reset function that actually works <br>
-Getting the Tank-Pong bullets to work <br>
-Attempting to implement something like Socket.io or make it online when I learn more. <br>
-Make it more faithful to the original
## Key Takeaways
-Plan out how I am going to tackle new frameworks better in the future. <br>
-Spend more time getting my MVP mechanics and the map done instead of working on getting sprites to work first day.<br>
-Phaser is alot of fun
